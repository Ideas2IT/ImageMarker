===========

Image Editor - A simple and basic image editing tool with HTML5 Canvas.

Designed to be easily embedded within web application. This is a HTML 5 canvas based image editor, that allows to use basic tools like pencil, circle, line, text, etc
and draw basic images and view your drawing as separate image. This supports operations like undo and redo too.

The default drawing tool at the time we load is Pencil. We can select any tool by just clicking on the tools shown.

Support fundus images, set of image stamps that can be just placed on top of the image created in drawing area. 
Just click any stamp and click on the drawing area where you want to place.

Few basic colors are available in color panel for changing the colors of drawing. Colors are not applicable for fundus images.

We have used ExtJS and JQuery libraries for features like buttons and scrolling etc.

The images that we create and save can be viewed below the drawing area in a horizontal scroller. Each such image can be individually clicked,
so that it is loaded back again in drawing area. We can further draw and touch this, and either update by clicking the Update button or save as
new image using Save button.
